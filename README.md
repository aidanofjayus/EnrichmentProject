# Enrichment Project

## This Week:

- Added an updates-per-second limiter into the game loop
- Started work on a state managing class, to easily sort keys, renders, and updates into different screens

## Last Week:

- Added the game loop
- Added fundamentals required to start the game loop
- Began an ongoing argument about what the Main class should be called

## About Us:
This is the repository that Aidan & Bryce are posting code to so they can link computers from school to their own. This allows for a cleaner workspace, and wouldn't be possible without Frank. 

#### Thanks Frank
